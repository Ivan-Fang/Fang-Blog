# Fang Blog
* Fang Blog is a "blog website project". Users can create their own account, publish articles, and read others released articles.
* This project is developed in client-side-render (CSR) mode. The details are as follows.
  * Backend
    * We use `MySQL` to create and manage database.
    * We use `MyBatis` to connect and operate database.
    * We use `SpringBoot 3` to implement backend business, which includes (1) CRUD of users' information and avatar uploading; (2) CRUD of articles; (3) CRUD of article categories.
    * We use `JWT` (Json Web Token) to store the information of current logged-in user.
    * We use `md5` to encrypt users' password.
    * We use `Redis` to store valid JWT. If current user's JWT has expired, the system would ask him to login again.
    * We connect to the bucket in `AWS S3` to store avatars and article covers.
  * Frontend
    * We use `Vue 3` as frontend development framework.
    * We use `Element Plus` as frontend UI framework.
    * We use `Axios` to send ajax request.
